# Creative Brushes

Creative brushes will allow you to direct autonomous drawing agents to draw creative sketches.  
The drawing agents act as interesting and non-predictable brushes that will steer you in the right creative direction.  
This system draws inspiration from natural dynamic drawing mediums that add their own touch to the artwork, such as watercolors and Turkish marbling art (Ebru).

## Flow Field Following
### Flow Fields

Flow fields are that store directions. In our 2d case it is a 2d matrix that stores 2d vectors.

![](reportAssets/flowFields.png)

We can make our agents follow this flow fields rather than seeking a target as explained previously. To do that we query the flow field to obtain the corresponding vector to be followed depending on the agents curent position. Than we set the agents desired vector with the vector that is returned by the flow field.

A parameter of a flow field is its resolution. We can have a flow field that has a vector for each pixel in the canvas but its often computationally unfeasible, thus lower resolution flow fiewlds are often used in practice where the canvas is divided into a grid of pixels and each cell of pixels have a common direction vector.

The resolution of the flow field is a major parameter to alter the drawing behaviour, thus we will have a *flowFieldResolution* drawing parameter.

## Modifying the flow field

To direct the agents path we can alter the flow field. To do that we define a radius and attract the the vectors within that radius to the mouse location. With this method we can essentially draw on a path on the flow field and the agents that come accross our path will follow it.  However a problem with this method is that at the end of the path a black hole forms where every vector within that radius points to the center and any agent that come accross the black hole gets stuck. To solve this issue we take the mouse location of the previous timestep and extrapolate the position of the next mouse location such that it falls on the rim of the attraction circle.

**Equation for the Attract Point**
$$
\mathbf{futureTarget} = \mathbf{target\_pos} + \mathbf{velocity}
$$

Where:

- $\mathbf{velocity} = \mathbf{target\_pos} - \mathbf{previousTarget}$
- $\|\mathbf{velocity}\| = \text{radius\_pixel}$ (scaled to match the radius)

    <img src="reportAssets/flowFF.gif" alt="Ebru Example" style="width: 250px; height: auto; border: 2px solid #ddd; border-radius: 5px;">
</div>


Note that the agents start drawing once they enter the attraction radius of the path and they gradually increase their stroke once they enter the radius and decrease their stroke once they leave the attraction radius for a smooth effect.  

This process in total gives us three drawing parameters that can be modified to alter the drawing behaviour.

- AttractionRadius
- StrokeUp
- StrokeDown

### Multiple Flow Fields

When the drawn path directs towards the flow field we get sub-optimal drawing performance from agents. To owecome this issue we 4 flow fields in 4 directions(left to right, top to bottom and etc) and let 4 sets of agent groups track these fields. As a result more coherent drawings for different angled paths are obtained.

## How to find good parameters that draw good

So far a dozen parameters that alter the end drawing drastically have mentioned. These parameters have weird interactions with each other and often yield unexpected results. To find a good configuration we set reasonable ranges for each parameter and used two methods to find the configurations we liked, manual configuration and evolutionary search.

### Define reasonable ranges for each parameter

| Parameter                | Min  | Max  | Step  |
|--------------------------|------|------|-------|
| numOfVehicles            | 1    | 300  | 1     |
| trackingIterations       | 100  | 1500 | 50    |
| flowFieldResolution      | 4    | 200  | 1     |
| attractionRadius         | 5    | 100  | 5     |
| maxVehicleForce          | 0.2  | 5    | 0.1   |
| maxVehicleSpeed          | 1    | 10   | 0.5   |
| maxVehicleStroke         | 1    | 10   | 0.5   |
| maxVehicleTrailLength    | 10   | 200  | 10    |
| vehicleStrokeUp          | 0.1  | 1    | 0.1   |
| vehicleStrokeDecay       | 0.1  | 1    | 0.1   |
| filteredOrientations     | 1    | 4    | 1     |

### Evolutionary Search
The **evolutionary search** in this project is inspired by natural selection. It helps optimize the parameters of autonomous drawing agents to create more creative and visually appealing drawings. The process involves steps like mutation, crossover, and selection to improve the parameters over time.

#### How It Works

The evolutionary search process follows these steps:

1. **Initialization**:  
   - The process begins by generating random parameter sets. Each set defines characteristics like the number of agents, how long they track paths, and the resolution of the flow field.

2. **Evaluation**:  
   - Each parameter set is tested to see how well it performs. This could mean how visually appealing the drawing is or how well the agents follow the desired paths.

3. **Selection**:  
   - The best-performing parameter sets are chosen to move forward. These are the ones that produce the most effective or creative drawings.

4. **Crossover**:  
   - Two selected parameter sets are combined to create a new one. This mixes traits from both sets, creating new possibilities.

5. **Mutation**:  
   - Small random changes are applied to some parameters. This keeps the process flexible and helps the system try out new ideas.

6. **Iteration**:  
   - These steps are repeated over multiple rounds, or generations, until the system finds a parameter set that works well or reaches a stopping point.

#### Why Itâ€™s Useful

The evolutionary search is important because it:

- Automatically adjusts parameters to create better and more unique drawings.  
- Explores a wide range of parameter combinations without requiring manual tuning.  
- Helps the agents interact effectively with flow fields, resulting in smoother and more creative outputs.  

By using evolutionary search, the project achieves diverse and creative results while reducing the need for human intervention in fine-tuning parameters.
